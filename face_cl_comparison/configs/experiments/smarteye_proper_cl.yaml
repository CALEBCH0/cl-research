# What this will test:
# Experience 1: Learn identity 001
# Experience 2: Learn identity 002 (while remembering 001) 
# Experience 3: Learn identity 003 (while remembering 001, 002)
# ...
# Experience 17: Learn identity 019 (while remembering all previous 16)
#
# Expected Results:
# - Naive: Will forget early identities (catastrophic forgetting)
# - SLDA: Should maintain good performance on all identities  
# - iCaRL: Should use exemplars to maintain good performance
