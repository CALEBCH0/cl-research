# Quick Test Summary:
# ==================
# - 2 strategies: Naive vs SLDA
# - 2 experiences: 47 classes each
# - 1 epoch per experience
# - EfficientNet B0 (faster than B1)
# - Batch size 32 (2x normal)
#
# Expected Runtime: ~2-5 minutes total
#
# Expected Results:
# - SLDA: ~95-100% accuracy
# - Naive: ~50-70% accuracy (forgetting on first half)
#
# This config is perfect for:
# - Testing if the dataset loads correctly
# - Verifying the pipeline works
# - Quick strategy comparison
# - Debugging issues
