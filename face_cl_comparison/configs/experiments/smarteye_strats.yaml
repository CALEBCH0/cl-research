# Expected Performance Ranking (best to worst):
# 1. SLDA Pure: ~99% (excellent for face recognition)
# 2. SLDA + Replay: ~98% (hybrid approach)  
# 3. iCaRL: ~96% (exemplar-based with prototypes)
# 4. Replay Pure: ~85-90% (replay helps but no embedding optimization)
# 5. EWC: ~70-80% (regularization approach)
# 6. Naive: ~6% (catastrophic forgetting)
#
# This comparison will show:
# - Pure embedding methods (SLDA) excel at face recognition CL
# - Replay methods provide good baseline performance
# - Hybrid approaches can combine benefits
# - Regularization methods (EWC) struggle with many tasks
