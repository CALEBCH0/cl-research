# This will create TRUE continual learning:
# Experience 1: Learn identity 001
# Experience 2: Learn identity 002 (must remember 001)  
# Experience 3: Learn identity 003 (must remember 001, 002)
# ...
# Experience 17: Learn identity 019 (must remember all 16 previous)
#
# Expected Results:
# - Naive: ~10-30% (severe forgetting)
# - SLDA: ~95-99% (excellent continual learning)
# - Replay: ~70-85% (good but limited by memory)
# - iCaRL: ~80-90% (exemplar-based approach)
